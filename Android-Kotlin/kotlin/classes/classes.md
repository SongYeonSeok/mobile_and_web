# 1. Kotlin OOP
- What is OOP?
  - OOP stands for **Object-Oriented Programming.**
  - Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.
  - OOP has several advantages over procedural programming:
    - OOP is faster and easier to execute.
    - OOP provides a clear structure for the programs.
    - OOP helps to keep the Kotlin code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug.
    - OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time.

> **Tip** : The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place then at a single place and reuse then instead of repeating it.

- What are Classes and Objects?
  - Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.
  
  | class | objects|
  |:---:|:---:|
  |```Fruit```|```Apple```, ```Banana```, ```Mango```|
  |```Car```|```Volvo```, ```Audi```, ```Toyota```|
  
  - So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
  - When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.
  
# 2. Kotlin Classes/Objects
- Everything in Kotlin is associated with classes and objects, along with its properties and functions.
- For example: 
# 3. Kotlin Constructors

# 4. Kotlin Class Functions

# 5. Kotlin Inheritance

# 6. Kotlin Examples

# 7. Kotlin Exercises

# 8. Kotlin Compiler
